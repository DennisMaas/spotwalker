# the-gramf-working-title
My capstone project, developed during the final stage at neue fische bootcamp. 

The goal of this project is to apply the techniques that I have learned during the last 12 weeks. 
12 weeks that sum up to about 600 hours of practical expierience in hands-on developing, using Git, Github, pairprogramming, 
codereviews, ticketing, testing and tears of joy and of frustration.

My working demo can be found at [https://spotwalker.de](https://spotwalker.de). Please be respectful and donÂ´t delete or change entries, and if you want to add an entry to try it out, 
please delete it afterwards. If you have any questions, please feel free to hit me up on [xing](https://xing.to/DennisMaas) or [linkedin](www.linkedin.com/in/dennis-b-maas) or of course here on github.

I am open for a new job remote or in Hamburg, Germany. 
See you soon!
